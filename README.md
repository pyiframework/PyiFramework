#The Pyi Framework

Hello, World!

This is the Pyi Framework (pronounced Pi, as in 3.14 Pi). The Pyi Framework is open source, simple, and fast.

Pyi lets you create and edit multiple pages of a website by editing just one file, or an easy to control set of files.
No more tedious updates or repeated code, and no more clunky CMS when you just need something simple and lightweight.

Read more about the Pyi Framework in the Documentation (/docs/index.php).

#v1.2.0 Roadmap
Fix CSS3 shield logo height.  
Move the php code that is at the beginning of every page to its own file for easier editing.  
Define php include file paths in a simpler way.

#CURRENT VERSION - v1.1.0
Updated: July 19 2015

The Pyi Framework is fully HTML5 and CSS3 compliant.
