<p>Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to the Pyi Framework (pronounced Pi, as in 3.14 Pi). Astronauts, war heroes, Olympians -- none of these people have used the Pyi Framework. In fact they don't even know what it is! But you do. Congratulations.</p>

<p>Pyi lets you create and edit multiple pages of a website by editing just one file, or a set of files. No more tedious updates or repeated code, and no more clunky CMS when you just need something simple and lightweight.</p>

<h1>
<a id="featured-example" class="anchor" href="#featured-example" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Featured Example</h1>

<p>To see what a simple website built entirely on the Pyi Framework can look like check out <a href="http://WalvinMedia.com">http://WalvinMedia.com</a></p>

<h1>
<a id="how-it-works" class="anchor" href="#how-it-works" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>How It Works</h1>

<p>Pyi divides the primary pieces of your website (like your header, footer, navigation, etc.) into their own files. You code them once and never worry about them again.</p>

<p>Each of these segments are then combined into a single file and served to the browser. You can include these segments whenever you want and you can still customize every page's unique code separately.</p>

<h1>
<a id="what-can-i-make-with-pyi" class="anchor" href="#what-can-i-make-with-pyi" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What can I make with Pyi?</h1>

<p>You can use Pyi to quickly create a brochure site, mock-up a prototype design, or make a full-fledged website. The sky is the limit.</p>

<p>The Pyi Framework is great for developers who create brochure type sites, but don't want the bulk and complications of a full CMS.</p>

<h1>
<a id="who-is-pyi-for" class="anchor" href="#who-is-pyi-for" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Who is Pyi For?</h1>

<p>Pyi is for developers who like to code websites by hand but still need a fast and easy way to create and edit their projects.</p>

<p>Pyi is not a CMS, there's no automation or back-end. If you're not comfortable editing HTML, CSS, and PHP then the Pyi Framework probably isn't what you need.</p>

<h1>
<a id="what-is-pyi-made-of" class="anchor" href="#what-is-pyi-made-of" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>What is Pyi made of?</h1>

<p>The Pyi Framework uses HTML5, CSS3, and PHP. You can add anything else you want. Pyi is extremely flexible.</p>

<a id="ready" class="anchor" href="#ready" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Ready?</h1>
