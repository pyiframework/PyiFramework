{"name":"Pyi Framework","tagline":"The Pyi Framework Official Page","body":"# Pyi Framework\r\n\r\nWelcome, ladies and gentlemen, to the Pyi Framework (pronounced Pi, as in 3.14 Pi). Astronauts, war heroes, Olympians -- none of these people have used the Pyi Framework. In fact they don't even know what it is! But you do. Congratulations.\r\n\r\nPyi lets you create and edit multiple pages of a website by editing just one file, or a set of files. No more tedious updates or repeated code, and no more clunky CMS when you just need something simple and lightweight.\r\n\r\n#Demo\r\nView the demo at [http://KevinPybus.com/pyi](http://KevinPybus.com/pyi)\r\n\r\n# How It Works\r\nPyi divides the primary pieces of your website (like your header, footer, navigation, etc.) into their own files. You code them once and never worry about them again.\r\n\r\nEach of these segments are then combined into a single file and served to the browser. You can include these segments whenever you want and you can still customize every page's unique code separately.\r\n\r\n# What can I make with Pyi?\r\nYou can use Pyi to quickly create a brochure site, mock-up a prototype design, or make a full-fledged website. The sky is the limit.\r\n\r\nThe Pyi Framework is great for developers who create brochure type sites, but don't want the bulk and complications of a full CMS.\r\n\r\n# Who is Pyi For?\r\nPyi is for developers who like to code websites by hand but still need a fast and easy way to create and edit their projects.\r\n\r\nPyi is not a CMS, there's no automation or back-end. If you're not comfortable editing HTML, CSS, and PHP then the Pyi Framework probably isn't what you need.\r\n\r\n# What is Pyi made of?\r\nThe Pyi Framework uses HTML5, CSS3, and PHP. You can add anything else you want. Pyi is extremely flexible.\r\n\r\n# Ready?\r\nSo, who is ready to make some websites?
