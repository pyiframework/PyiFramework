Astronauts, war heroes, Olympians -- none of these people have used the Pyi Framework, they don't even know what it is. But you do. Congratulations.\r\n\r\nPyi lets you create and edit multiple pages of a website by editing just one file, or a set of files. No more tedious updates or repeated code, and no more clunky CMS when you just need something simple and lightweight.\r\n\r\nSo, who is ready to make some websites?\r\n\r\n(For the record this is our official page. Come back soon for more info.)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
